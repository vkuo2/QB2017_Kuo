## OVERVIEW

In this Assignment, we extend our understanding of diversity from the spatial dimension to the temporal dimension. 

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1. wrangle a large dataset to visualize and analyze time series data
2. test hypotheses from experiments with temporal data
3. quantify temporal $\beta$-diversity and stability

## Directions:
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
2. Complete as much of the exercise as possible during class; what you do not complete in class will need to be done on your own outside of class.
3. Use the Handout as a guide; it contains a more complete description of data sets along with the proper scripting needed to carry out the exercise.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this exercise document; they also correspond to the Handout.
Space for your answer is provided in this document and indicated by the ">" character.
If you need a second paragraph be sure to start the first line with ">".
5. Before you leave the classroom, **push** this file to your GitHub repo.
6. When you are done with the Assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a html file.
7. After Knitting, please submit the completed Assignment by creating a **pull request** via GitHub.
Your pull request should include this file *temporal_assignment.Rmd* and the html output of `Knitr` (*temporal_assignment.html*).

## 1) R SETUP

Typically, the first thing you will do in either an R script or an RMarkdown file is setup your environment. 
This includes things such as setting the working directory and loading any packages that you will need.

In the R code chunk below, provide the code to:  

1. clear your R environment,
2. print your current working directory,
3. set your working directory to your "*/Week5-Temporal*" folder, and 
4. load any packages you need to complete the assignment.

```{r}
# Set working directory #
rm(list = ls())
getwd() 
#setwd("C:/Users/Venus/Github/QB2017_Kuo/Week5-Temporal")
setwd("/Users/vkuo/GitHub/QB2017_Kuo/Week5-Temporal/")

# Require or install packages #
package.list <- c('vegan', 'tidyr', 'dplyr', 'codyn', 'ggplot2', 'cowplot', 'MullerPlot', 'RColorBrewer', 'reshape2', 'lubridate', 'TTR', 'xtable', 'multcomp', 'pander', 'png', 'grid', 'teries', 'nlme', 'forecast', 'lsmeans') 
for (package in package.list) {
  if (!require(package, character.only=T, quietly=T)) { 
    install.packages(package)
    library(package, character.only=T)
} }
```

## 2) LOADING DATA
### Load dataset
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. load the `portal` dataset from in the "*/Week5/data*" folder, and
2. explore the structure of the dataset.

```{r}
# Load portal dataset #
portal <- read.table("data/combined.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)

# Venus the Explorer #
str(portal)
length(unique(portal$plot_id))
length(unique(portal$species))
```

***Question 1***:  Describe some of the attributes of the `portal` dataset.  

a.  How many plots are in `portal`?
b.  How many rodent species are there in the `portal` dataset?

> ***Answer 1a***:  There are 24 plots.
> ***Answer 1b***:  There are 40 rodent species.

## 3) WRANGLING THE PORTAL DATASET

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. Create a site-by-species matrix for any year of your choosing.
2. Create a vector of plot_type for sites in the site-by-species matrix.
3. Analyze alpha diversity (e.g., Shannon/Simpson) across the sites for that year.
4. Create a PCoA ordination of your site-by-species matrix.
5. Using the hypothesis testing tools you learned in the beta-diversity module, test the hypothesis that species abundances across sites vary as a factor of treatment type (i.e., plot_type). 

```{r}
# Create new date vector #
portal <- unite(portal, col = date , c(year, month, day), sep = "-", remove = FALSE)
# Create new taxon vector # 
portal <- unite(portal, col = taxon, c(genus, species), sep = "_" , remove = FALSE)
# Making time by species matrix #
time.by.species <- group_by(portal, year, plot_id, plot_type) %>% count(taxon) %>% spread(key = taxon, value = n, fill = 0)
# Chose year 1984 too look at #
dplyr::filter(time.by.species, year == 1984)
# Chose plot 5 to look at #
dplyr::filter(time.by.species, plot_id == 5)
# Converting tidyr object into data frame #
time.by.species <- as.data.frame(time.by.species)
time.by.species

## Made site by species matrix for the year 1977 ##
portal1977 <- subset(time.by.species, year == 1977)

# Make vector for plot treatment type #
treatment <- portal1977$plot_type

# Take out first 3 columns # 
portal1977 <- c(portal1977[, -1:-3])

## Analyze alpha diversity across sites ##
alpha <- rbind(diversity(portal1977[1:23,], index="shannon"))
alpha

## Ordination of site by species matrix ##
# Principal Coordinate Analysis #
portal.db <- vegdist(portal1977, method = "bray", upper = TRUE , diag = TRUE)
pcoa <- cmdscale(portal.db, eig = TRUE, k = 3)
# Interpreting PCoA output # 
explainvar1 <- round(pcoa$eig[1] / sum(pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
explainvar2 <- round(pcoa$eig[2] / sum(pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
explainvar3 <- round(pcoa$eig[3] / sum(pcoa$eig), 3) * 100
sum.eig <- sum(explainvar1, explainvar2, explainvar3)

explainvar1
explainvar2
explainvar3
sum.eig

## Plot the PCoA ##
# Define Plot Parameters
par(mar = c(5, 5, 1, 2) + 0.1)
# Initiate Plot
plot(pcoa$points[ ,1], pcoa$points[ ,2],
     xlab = paste("PCoA 1 (", explainvar1, "%)", sep = ""),
     ylab = paste("PCoA 2 (", explainvar2, "%)", sep = ""),
     pch = 16, cex = 2.0, type = "n", cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.2, axes = FALSE)

# Add Axes
axis(side = 1, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1)
axis(side = 2, labels = T, lwd.ticks = 2, cex.axis = 1.2, las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, lty = 3)
box(lwd = 2)

# Add Points & Labels
points(pcoa$points[ ,1], pcoa$points[ ,2],
       pch = 19, cex = 3, bg = "gray", col = "gray")
text(pcoa$points[ ,1], pcoa$points[ ,2],
     labels = row.names(pcoa$points))

## Hypothesis testing: Beta-diversity ##
# Create factor vector in Doubs River # 
treatment <- c(rep("HQ", 13), rep("MQ", 5), rep("LQ", 6), rep("MQ", 5))

# Run PERMANOVA with adonis function #
adonis(fish ~ quality, method = "bray", permutations = 999)

indval <- multipatt(fish, cluster = quality, func = "IndVal.g", control = how(nperm=999))
summary(indval)

fish.rel <- decostand(fish, method = "total")
phi <- multipatt(fish.rel, cluster = quality, func = "r.g", control = how(nperm=999))
summary(phi)


```
